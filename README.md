## To be finalized:
* Creating custom pipelines with Nipype - Nov 8 -- <- Olivia has material/can lead the Miykeal tutorials
  * Why nipype instead of bash?  
  * Pipeline for parameter tweaking (parallelizing a parameter search)
  * Pipeline for studies (parallelizing subject processing)
  * Brief intro to custom interfaces

* Singularity containers
  * Packaging a nipype pipeline into a singularity image
  * Run a singularity image on Compute Canada

* Testing and continuous integration (Igor)
  * Unittest for python
  * Googletest for c++
  * Continuous integration  with gitlab
  * Continuous integration with github


## Current thoughts 

* Have the tutorials done on Friday mornings (9.30 to 12) starting at the beginning of September. 

* Each tutorial takes around 2 hours with a 10 minute break during the 2 hours.

* Must have a tutorial outline and sample data/task for everyone to work on.

* Tutorials will be recored and will make available for new students.
