## Objective:

To go over some practical topics and "good practices" related to using `git` for personal and collaborative projects.

## Prerequisites (Homework! Do this on your own before the tutorial):

- Ensure you have git installed
  * Available from the Terminal on Mac and Linux
  * [Install on Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - Note: This also installs a "Git Bash" shell environment. Make sure you know how to launch it.

- Install a Git GUI client
  * Mac and Windows: I'll be using [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for the demo
  * Linux: there are many options available, like [SmartGit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/download/)

- Install a visual `diff` tool if you don't have one
  * I'll be using `Meld`:
    - [Windows](https://meldmerge.org/)
    - [Mac](https://yousseb.github.io/meld/)
    - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt-get install meld`
 
 - Git Essentials (online video course):
   * Login with Western credentials [here](https://linkedinlearning.uwo.ca/).
   * [Git Essentials](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-essential-training-the-basics) course. Sections 2-5 in particular are good to go over. Some other topics, like `.gitignore`, will be introduced during the tutorial.
 - Make an account on GitHub if you don't have one already.
